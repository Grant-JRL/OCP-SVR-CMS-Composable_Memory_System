# CMS Academic/research workstream
[insert group charter and contacts]


## What's all this then?
Every year the CMS academic workstream sets review-windows wherein research papers that are CXL or CXL adjacent are proposed for review by the group. 

## How to navigate this directory tree
Each year reflects the review work of the CMS research workstream. In each directory there are review windows (e.g. xHCyy for now, we seem to be on a bi-annual cadence). In each r
eview window there are another two folders, one for the selected work for the review window and another for the papers reviewed.
