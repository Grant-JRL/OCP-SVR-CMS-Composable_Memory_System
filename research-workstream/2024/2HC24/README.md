#Committing new content, reviewing, and browsing
If the review window is active, all content is likely in the proposed folder. If you're just browsing prior review windows, all selected works are in 'selected' and will also likely have additional content beyond the reviews (e.g. additional commentary from the original authors, links to recordings, etc.) but all works considered for the review window will be in the 'proposed' directory. 

##Instructions for committing new content
If this is an active review window, and you are committing a review of a proposed paper, please do the following. 
 - Fetch and merge latest, and if this is a local fork, please make sure you've fetched upstream to merge. 
 - Create a new branch 
   - In the 'proposed' directory find your publication for review and create a folder with your name
      - If the publication does not have a review folder, please create it using the title of the work. Use best judgement on length.
   - Either add your .md review or create a markdown file and copy/paste your review into it. 
   - upload any figures to be referenced by your markdown review in this folder as well. No ppt/word/etc. yet please, we don't have a git LFS set up at the moment. 
 - Push branch to your local fork and issue a pull request to the main repo
 - Select reviewers for your merge request
 - Loop as needed until merge request accepted

##Instructions for committing reviews

Make sure you've fetched latest before adding new content and if this is a local fork that your fork is also synced, please and thank you. 

If you're committing a new content review see above, if you have comments or additions to already submitted reviews please consider the following. If you have commentary on a review of a proposed work and it has not yet been merged, chime in on the merge request

If the review was already merged into main, review the instructions for committing new content. In the reviewer's folder of a paper, add another markdown file with your comments and add your name to the title of the file. Follow the branch/merge instructions.
