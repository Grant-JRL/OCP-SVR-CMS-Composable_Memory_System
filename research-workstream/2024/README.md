# How to navigate this directory tree

Each year reflects the review work of the CMS research workstream. In each directory there are review windows (e.g. xHCyy for now, we seem to be on a bi-annual cadence). In each review window there are another two folders, one for the selected work for the review window and another for the papers reviewed.
